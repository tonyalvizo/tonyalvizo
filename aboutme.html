							<p><b>Antonio Alvizo Jr</b> <br>
								<b>Born in August 1993</b><br>
								<b>Here is a little bit of a back story.</b><br>
							My name is Antonio but everybody calls me Tony. I am currently 24 years old. I was born and raised Los Angeles, Huntington Park to be specific. I am currently attending California State University of Northridge studying Computer Information Technology. My future plans involve assisting some start up companies manage their IT systems then later transferring to a bigger corporation like Google, or Facebook. Then after that I would like to start my own IT company that specializes in Web Design. <br>
							Somewhere along this journey I discovered a passion for Graphic Design and photography. Around 2013 when Instagram was still fairly new I decided I wanted to create my own instagram page and share cars with other since no other pages would ever share my car. Since I had a 1997 Honda Prelude at the time I decided to call this page "Prelude Nation". It began with simply sharing other preludes I would find on google or Tumblr to later sharing other Instagram user's preludes too. I built a little buzz and saw how other pages began to sell stickers with their names on them so I decided to do that too. I met a friend who was able to make this into a reality and before I knew it I was selling stickers online through an ecommerce platform known as Bigcartel.com. Fast forward a couple years we now have over 33k followers and full blow e-commerce website which I manage all by myself. All the designs, images everything on the website was done by me.<br>
						This is when I realized I loved learning. I taught myself how to use Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator in order to create new designs for my instagram page. Those self-taught skills have been useful to me til' this very day. I know am a free-lance Graphic Designer and Photographer who loves getting new clients and making their dreams come to reality. My dream has always been to inspire and create and that is what I will always pursue in my life. My Resume will be attached below for potential clients or job offers. </p>
